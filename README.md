## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS
- Git
- GitHub

### What I learned

This challenge was the first time I used Git and GitHub. Although it seemed complicated at first, I managed to learn the basics of these tools and I feel ready
to use them again in any project.
Also, due to its simplicity, this was a good challenge to remember basic HTML and CSS.

### Continued development

I intend to continue learning Git and, at the same time, develop my skills in front-end technologies.
Another knowledge I need to improve is documentation, so I hope to practice this whenever possible.

### Useful resources

- [Git documentation](https://git-scm.com/doc) - This helped me to take my firsts steps on Git and for sure will help a lot in future.
